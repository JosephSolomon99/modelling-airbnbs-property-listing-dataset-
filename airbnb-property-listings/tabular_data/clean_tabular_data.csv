evening andor next morning breakfast or buying and bringing groceries to cook because we are 4 km from the main paved road and driving after dark is highly discouraged until drivers have quite some experience on costa rican roads also most guests prefer to settle in upon arrival and not to have to get back in the car and drive out to dinner we provide a catering menu to each guest once reserved but the caterer requires advance notice of selected meals and times guests would like meals delivered we do not have a liquor license and guests must bring their own beerwinerum etc the tap water is

things to notenq annq why do you rent this placena we use it one month per year at most why keep this jewel to ourselves please enjoy it as if its your place as wellnnq why is there no internetna i work in the hightech sector i am connected 247 i wanted a place where time stands still be close to nature and could truly get away from it all we want to share not only the place but the experience as wellnnq what if i need something from youna just send me a text message or give me a ring youll get my number after your booking is confirmednnq the fridge is very small will we starve to deathna hey no drama here yes the fridge is small but there is also an ice cooler you may use simply bring your own ice and please drain it before leaving that should keep you alive for a bit longer nnq should i bring sheets and towelsna no worries we will provide bedding and towels blankets soap shampoo and toilet paper if you need anything else please let me know and i will do anything in my power to have it ready before your arrivalnnq nice wood stove do i can have to purchase firewoodna no need to do so i usually provide plenty of firewood for my guests you may find it in the back deck please cover the wood with the tarp after youre done to protect it from the rain and allow other guests to warm themselves too nnq i love this place can i extend my stayna if available sure knock yourself out simply get to an internet cafe or use your smart phone and book again but please contact me beforehand out of courtesynnq great decoration what style is itna shaker style from wikipedia shaker furniture is a distinctive style of furniture developed by the united society of believers in christs second appearing commonly known as shakers a religious sect that had guiding principles of simplicity utility and honesty their beliefs were reflected in the wellmade furniture of minimalist designs we are not shakers but we are guided by the same principlesnnq whats the sleeping situationna well youre welcome to sleep any way youd like but to be more specific there are two bedrooms both with fullsize beds one bedroom has a platform bed with a memory foam mattress and the other one a murphy bed with a memory foam topper there are also two fullsize futons located next to the stove in the living room if youre not into futons there is also a comfy inflatable fullsize bed found in the closet where the murphy bed is please take your picknnq there are no bathroom faucetsna mmm that wasnt a question but yes theyre there these faucets and vanity were a diy project of my own design using copper piping and shutoff valves and reclaimed wood just turn the valves one quarter of the way counterclockwise to open the water supply pretty cool hughnnq is the cabin selfsustainablena not yet but im working on it with your booking contribution i created a system to capture rain water to the cistern below the mountain is dry and water is a precious commodity here and eventually i will install solar panels on the roof currently all waste water goes into a septic tank so as soon as i implement the above steps the cabin will technically be able to be offgridnnq what other environmental measures have you implementedna in addition to capturing water from rain and eventually energy from the sun i have renovated the bathroom and kitchen using reclaimed wood some of it from a nearby old farm the dish and body soaps and most housecleaning products are environmentallyfriendly to help natural decomposition of waste water in the septic system the floor is made up of natural cork and wood and the entire place was recently reinsulated to improve energy efficiency if youd like to know more about our ecoefforts please contact mennq why are there so many water jugs in the kitchenna drinking water in colorful jugs as well as the 5gal dispenser just outside the kitchen comes from a nearby natural water spring best tasting water i ever had i leave plenty of it for you because tap water is not potable in fact i ask my guests to be mindful of tap water usage because there is no well or citypiped water source instead water is collected to a cistern below from rain or trucked in by me if need be it is therefore a precious commodity simply shut off faucets when not in use be careful not to leave the toilet running and take shorter showers if possible thats it nnq how is the house heatedna the main source of heat is the wood stove youll be surprise how efficient this rustic appliance is depending on the temp it may take a couple of hours to bring the thermometer up to your standard so exercise a little patience there is a heatinfused fan and a tea pot on top of the stove the fan will propagate the heat efficiently and the tea pot with water will act as a natural humidifier making you more comfortable in addition there is a wall heater in the kitchen dial and another one in the bathroom switch that you can control finally a baseboard heater in the entrance hallway will keep the bedrooms and water pipes warm in short youll be cozynnq ok so i will be warm in winter what about the height of the summer heatna oh youll will be warm in summer alright but seriously there is an old and fairly inefficient ac wall unit in the dining room there is also a ceiling fan in the living room and another one in one of the bedrooms ive found that opening the windows creates a nice airflow that cools the place down but if youre looking for a inhouse refrigerator this small cabin may not be for younnq whats the deal with you being a superhostna well then since you askim a superhost because were relaxed about our guests despite us having fulltime jobs of our own however ive come to be rather fond of that title and i dont appreciate when a guest leaves a review saying that the place was too isolated or that the place was not what they expected theres only about 40 pictures if a guest does not read the detailed description where i specify the exact distance to places or the meticulous portrayal of the house or whatever then their reviews should be kinder i truly enjoy 5star reviews if theres something you do not like while here i beg you to let me know and i promise to do what i can to revert your perspective remember communication is king,"['What this place offers', 'Bathroom', 'Hair dryer', 'Shampoo', 'Ivory conditioner',

few basics coffee tea tomato ketchup salt pepper etc just in case there is a small shop on site if you need any basic supplies toonnat the start of 2017 the cabin had a new fully insulated external cladding added to it in late 2019 we had the roof insulated also which is keeping everyone warmer in winter and cooler in summer however please remember that cabin is a simple wood construction so it most likely wont be as warm in winter as your home is so we do ask people to pack a few warmer clothes definitely some slippers and maybe use it as an excuse to get cosy under a blanket with someonennmobile signal has improved drastically in the past few years and we are able to easily stream films shows to our devices using 4g perfect for a lazy day in bed weve also been able to work

is great to get away from it all but in case of rainy days there is also a wall mounted tv which has no areal only tv via the internet so you can enjoy net flicksamazon prime etc occasionally we can have a poor signal due to being so rural but most of the time it works fine there is wifi in the log cabinnnthe log cabin is a 20minute walk outside the village and quite rural take care driving on the lanes as they are quite narrow and challenging at times late summer into autumn is when the farmers cut the hedges which can be frustrating as this reduces the beautiful view but this is not for long and the peace and tranquillity is still surrounding younndogs are very welcome it is the perfect place for wonderful walks across dartmoor national park the garden should be secure and private for them unless they are small enough to climb through the gate please let me know if you are bringing one on your booking there is a small charge of 10 per stay if you have one or two dogs if you have more than two dogs i would be grateful if you would contact me firstnnthere is an outdoor bath for two in a private garden so you can look up at the starsnthis is my favourite place but it is not

things to note other things to notenwell behaved dogs are very welcome there is a hose and a dog gate to help you keep them clean and dry if you could bring your own dog beds and keep them off your bed and the sofa i would be most gratefulnnthe double sofa bed is small which is why i have allowed for only one guest but it can fit two if you want a fourth person to stay it is an extra 10 a nightnnif you do use the sofa bed i am afraid you cannot use the log burning stove as the bed gets too close you do not need it for heating as there is a radiator anyway but it looks and smells lovely if there is just two of younnthere is an outside field kitchen under cover which consists of an small oven two hot plates and a chicken rotisserie which is amazing i am very grateful if you could leave this clean on departure to avoid a cleaning fee there is a small combination microwavecookergrill inside the log cabin toonnthe bathroom is heated by the sun and has a wonderfully hot shower in

1e308ef0-d2a6-4563-a105-3bfb693c09ac,Amazing pools,The Shed,the propertynnthe shed is named somewhat tongue in cheek by the owners family as it is about as far from a shed as you can get whether sitting out on the decking with its clear view glass balustrade or in the comfort of the lounge you have stunning views across avon beach and the solent to the isle of wight and the needles there is always something to watch at any time of year when you talk about a property one of the most important factors is location new for 2015 the chalet has it all from its prime sea front position to its proximity to such places as the beautiful new forest bournemouth lymington and christchurch there is so much to do right on your doorstep or within a very short drivennthe shed is fully equipped to a high standard with all you need to make your stay one of comfort and luxury there is a dishwasher so no arguments over the washing up separate fridge and freezer microwave and extra touches like a built in coffee maker bose sounddock and tvs in both bedrooms you have private parking adjacent to the chalet so you do not have to haul your luggage and shopping farnnthe shed is based within the boutique sandhills holiday park with its historic main house and leafy grounds the whole ambiance is one of relaxing in the country but with the sights and sounds of the sea the park facilities are available to all guests and include an adventure playground family bar with sky tv heated outdoor pool small gymnasium pool table launderette and mini mart store additionally there is free wifi in the lounge and bar areasnabout the local areanchristchurch was a renowned smuggling town and the shed is just a short walk from the historic mudeford quay where in 1784 smugglers skirmished with customs and excise officers so kids bring those cutlasses eye patches and skull and crossbones oh and a parrot if you have onennit is still a working quay today with fishing boats venturing out most days so why not say hello to pete on boat deja vu su21 and see how his day has been or wave to him from your decking as he heads back from another successful day out if you fancy testing your skills out and bringing the catch home yourself pleasure fishing trips are available directly from the quay or we can help you organise in advance there are many pleasure trips to be had or if you fancy a thrill then why not hang on to your seats on the bay blast rib ridennthe quay is also famous for its crabbing from the quayside crabbers quay and has a childrens play park fish stall cafe the haven house inn and a large green area which is perfect for picnics ball games and kite flying you can catch the ferry to hengistbury head directly from the quay and visit its fantastic beaches and beach hutsnnchristchurch harbour is a great place for watersports from windsurfing to sailing and the highcliffe sailing club is based on the quay there is also an active rnli lifeboat station which practices launching weekly so you are almost bound to see their rather unusual lifeboat launch and recovery system in actionnnif walking or bird watching is your thing then you can do both without even getting in the car within an easy stroll you will find a nature reserve on the cliff top adjacent to highcliffe castle if you fancy a little longer out then why not try the circular walk through stanpit marshes and on to christchurch for a spot of lunch then take the tuckton ferry from outside the captains club to cross the river or walk over tuckton bridge a little further on if the ferry is not running and head across more picturesque marshes to the back of hengistbury head from there you can skirt the inside shoreline head up and over the top or use the beach as your route back to the beach huts and ferry home at the tip of the head who knows the haven house inn may tempt you with a thirst quencher before heading back to the luxuries of the chaletnndown at avon beach there is a cafrestaurant the noisy lobster and kiosks serving fish and chips coffee and ice cream there is a shop selling anything from localnational papers to clothes and holiday souvenirs and even a bakery on sitennif you head out in the car then the walks available to you are endless with the new forest on your doorstep and the purbecks within easy reach easily missed and of particular note is the area around keyhaven and lymington and in particular the sea wall walk past the now disused salt works and the spit and hurst castle which in itself is worth entry but make sure you have a few hours to sparennhistorically sailing and fishing are all part of the local heritage with such famous local sailing clubs as christchurch and lymington to hand more recently wind and kite surfing have become extremely popular along with kayaking and paddle boarding dont worry if you have never tried any of these or do not have any equipment as shore sports base themselves in the harbour and are more than happy to help outnnabout the area in generalnnchristchurch the sign says where time is pleasant and its right from the lively monday market to the great shops and restaurants along the high street it

if you like we have staff available to assist you and ensure you have what you need at all times you will be very well cared fornnsleeping in nature is something most of us dont do as we sleep in sealed rooms it can be transformative to sleep in a natural setting open to the cool night air listening to the crickets and chirping geckos the sounds of the nearby rushing stream with the fireflies glittering in the night dont let the unusual openness of the space deter you this is an experience you wont soon forgetbali 101nwelcome to bali no this is not like where you are coming from to hopefully enhance your experience we want to provide you with a bit of cultural context people often feel disappointed when they try to make bali what they are familiar with we hope by describing a few scenarios that this helps as bali has things about it that may be very different than you are used ton1 there is a lizard staring at me from the ceiling who pooped on the floor and there are ants crawling along the wall in the bathroom the outdoors will come inside crickets spiders and certainly a resident gecko and wasps will all join you in your living space no matter how fancy the villa there is no keeping them out given that all of our bathrooms are open air this is something to embrace as part of the experience and not be afraid as they are all harmlessn2 i can hear roosters and dogs and the temple and even the occasional pig being sacrificed at midnight oh and the crickets are too loud to sleep yes indeed all true when i think of bali i think of roosters they are very proud of their fighting cocks and spend a great deal of time with them often keeping them quite close to living spaces so your neighbor may very well have one our neighbor certainly has both and his dog barks a lot and has attempted to scare away many a guest but dont be afraid he is harmless the temple is a charming sound that echo thru the night and adds the to atmosphere but it can be less charming when they begin to sacrifice pigs at midnight peaceful bali well its all a matter of perspective bali is here to be itself not just to be a peaceful place for you to relax enjoy these new and unique sounds as part of the atmosphere and dont expect it to be an instagram photo it is a real living placen3 an old lady with a machete and no shirt on just wandered into my living room balinese have a very different relationship to personal privacy than we do it is not uncommon for neighbors or ricefield farms to wander into your space and personal property because they are curious about you or simply because they want to borrow your sugar they may not even ask as they would imagine you would do exactly the same this can be very startling at first and takes some getting used to you are welcome to ask them to leave but do keep in mind they are more than likely not there to harm you just used to sharing personal spacenn4 there are naked people in the stream by the house it wasnt very many years ago that all balinese women were topless as their normal daily attire now only the traditional old women still maintain this style of dress but it is still very common to see people publicly bathing in ricefield streams naked you may even see this from your front porch dont be alarmed this normal here and they will not even feel embarrassed if you wave uf04an5 the guy tried to over charge me there is a very different relationship to money here think of it as a tug of war with a rope in the middle its not that they are trying to steal from you or cheat you or have anything against you at all they are just pulling on the rope to get as much money as they can if you dont tug back then they won dont get angry or feel the need to have hurt feelings just negotiate calmly to lower the price to something fairer negotiate everything in every situation you will use these skills later when you need to ask for a raise with your boss n6 everything is damp yes this is the tropics and especially during the rainy season everything can feel a bit damp and can mildew quickly even within a day if your clothes need fresh laundering after being in a suitcase or if the sheets need to be changed for this reason just let us know and we will assist younwe hope these scenarios help you to be prepared if you face them and feel free to let us know should you need additional help

mood and most of all a glorious undertaking in enjoying all life has to offer in a great climate bounded by sun surf and sand we humbly submit that if you rent this home you will agree that from the desert to the sea throughout the entire state there is quite simply no finer home to experience the dream of southern california buckle up folks you are about to enter the water tower experiencennfor a video of the home please click on the video box in the photo montagennthe name says it all the water tower for the those unfamiliar with perhaps the most famous beachfront landmark in all of california lets start with a little history located in one of americas tallest ground to ceiling residential structures and serviced by a commercial elevator that whisks you upwards of close to one hundred feet in the sky this almost 3000 square foot home was in fact southern californias first manmade tourist attraction long before knotts and disneyland indeed before the first automobile was registered in orange county the water tower stood marveled at by visitors and locals alike as a wonder of engineering and architectural bravadonnas for the structure it stands over 85 feet tall and has three stories with windows on all sides this amazing home is beyond wellappointed it has been professionally renovated and decorated with first class amenities appliances thousandthread count linens and topshelf accoutrements so that your experience in southern california beach living is not only firstclass in every conceivable way but a memory you treasure forever no detail has gone unnoticed as the owners endeavored to create a home that will reward every person who enters an indelible lifetime memory the interior designers charge was simple pay tribute to the history of the water tower and when finished we wanted every guest who stays in the home to leave and tell everyone they know about the magic of the water tower experience as you can see from the photos we believe the decorators and designers hit this one out of the park the home has two garages an elevator four bedrooms three and onehalf bathrooms a fully stocked kitchen bar laundry room and the most amazing living room you will likely ever encounter with 360 degree views of southern california and beyondnnnow that we have the structure out of the way lets get to the fun stuff the water tower experience as natives know the debate has raged for years over what is more so cal orange county and its miles of pristine beaches or la with a bit more traffic but mountains and beaches and a whole lot of glitz as you enter the water tower experience this wont be an issue you are part of both tower locals however might argue as to whether or not she resides in sunset beach or seal beach as they both claim her it really doesnt matter as make no mistake about it while like the beaches the water tower belongs to all californians it is the love child of sunset beach but seal beach is very much the proud father as you stand on the sidewalk please take a moment to look up and take in the grandeur of this magnificent 19th century landmark which was once the tallest structure in orange county and today stands as the second tallest residential home in the united statesnnas you enter you will see the fine artwork on the doors and plaque detailing some of the history of this home which was built to
